## 🧪 Quick Try

```bash
bash run_me.sh

Now you copy output path after execute run_me.sh

```cd [paste here]

you see a file named give-me-name.sh, execute it

```bash give-me-name.sh

choose the name you want for your project, example: lofi

Type
```lofi
Then enter.

now start-[name].sh and stop-[name].sh is there

last step for enter the editor mode you execute the start-[name].sh

because in this example i gave name 'lofi' so it must be

```bash start-lofi.sh

and voila you are ready to start your project, you are in a new virtual terminal,

This virtual terminal will remain even if you exit to the main terminal,

Question:
how to exit the virtual terminal for a while and then come back again?

```tmux detach

Question:
How to get to virtual terminal? just execute start-[name].sh
```bash start-[name].sh

virtual terminal will remain even if closing the main terminal, unless you run stop-[name].sh from the main terminal,

virtual terminal will remain even if closing the main terminal,
