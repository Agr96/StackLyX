## 🧪 Quick Try

```bash
bash run_me.sh
```

Now you copy output path after execute run_me.sh

```bash
cd [paste here]
```

you see a file named give-me-name.sh, execute it

```bash
give-me-name.sh
```

choose the name you want for your project, example: lofi

Type
```bash
lofi
```
Then enter.

now start-[name].sh and stop-[name].sh is there

last step for enter the editor mode you execute the start-[name].sh

because in this example i gave name 'lofi' so it must be

```bash
start-lofi.sh
```

and voila you are ready to start your project, you are in a new virtual terminal,

This virtual terminal will remain even if you exit to the main terminal,

Question:
how to exit the virtual terminal for a while and then come back again?

```bash
tmux detach
```

Question:
How to get to virtual terminal? just execute start-[name].sh
```bash
start-[name].sh
```

virtual terminal will remain even if closing the main terminal, unless you run stop-[name].sh from the main terminal,

virtual terminal will remain even if closing the main terminal,
